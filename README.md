# Cloud-Detection

The goal of this project is the exploration and modeling of cloud detection in the polar regions based on radiance recorded automatically by the MISR sensor abroad the NASA satellite Terra. We will build a classification model to distinguish the presence of cloud from the absence of clouds in the images using given features.
